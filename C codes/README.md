DAQmx (Data Acquisition) is a library provided by National Instruments that allows you to interface with data acquisition devices. It provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable you to control and configure various aspects of data acquisition, including analog input, analog output, digital input/output, and more. In this documentation, we will provide an overview of the commonly used DAQmx APIs and explain their inputs and outputs.

1. DAQmxCreateTask
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxCreateTask(const char taskName[], TaskHandle *taskHandle)`
   - Input: `taskName` - Name of the task to be created.
   - Output: `taskHandle` - Handle to the created task.

   This API is used to create a new task that can be used to perform data acquisition operations. It takes a task name as input and provides a task handle as output, which is used to reference the created task in subsequent API calls.

2. DAQmxCreateAIVoltageChan
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxCreateAIVoltageChan(TaskHandle taskHandle, const char physicalChannel[], const char nameToAssignToChannel[], int32 terminalConfig, float64 minVal, float64 maxVal, int32 units, const char customScaleName[])`
   - Inputs:
     - `taskHandle` - Handle to the task to which the analog input voltage channel will be added.
     - `physicalChannel` - Specifies the physical channel(s) to be added (e.g., "Dev1/ai0" for the first analog input channel on device "Dev1").
     - `nameToAssignToChannel` - Name to assign to the added channel (optional, can be an empty string).
     - `terminalConfig` - Specifies the terminal configuration for the channel (e.g., DAQmx_Val_Diff for differential mode or DAQmx_Val_RSE for referenced single-ended mode).
     - `minVal` - Minimum expected voltage value for the channel.
     - `maxVal` - Maximum expected voltage value for the channel.
     - `units` - Specifies the units of the voltage values (e.g., DAQmx_Val_Volts).
     - `customScaleName` - Specifies a custom scale to apply to the acquired voltage values (optional, can be NULL).
   - Output: None

   This API is used to add an analog input voltage channel to a task. It specifies the physical channel, terminal configuration, voltage range, and units for the channel.

3. DAQmxCreateAOVoltageChan
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxCreateAOVoltageChan(TaskHandle taskHandle, const char physicalChannel[], const char nameToAssignToChannel[], float64 minVal, float64 maxVal, int32 units, const char customScaleName[])`
   - Inputs:
     - `taskHandle` - Handle to the task to which the analog output voltage channel will be added.
     - `physicalChannel` - Specifies the physical channel(s) to be added (e.g., "Dev1/ao0" for the first analog output channel on device "Dev1").
     - `nameToAssignToChannel` - Name to assign to the added channel (optional, can be an empty string).
     - `minVal` - Minimum allowed voltage output value for the channel.
     - `maxVal` - Maximum allowed voltage output value for the channel.
     - `units` - Specifies the units of the voltage values (e.g., DAQmx_Val_Volts).
     - `customScaleName` - Specifies a custom scale to apply to the output voltage values (optional, can be NULL).
   - Output: None

   This API is used to add an analog output voltage channel

 to a task. It specifies the physical channel, voltage range, and units for the channel.

4. DAQmxWriteAnalogF64
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxWriteAnalogF64(TaskHandle taskHandle, int32 numSampsPerChan, bool32 autoStart, float64 timeout, bool32 dataLayout, const float64 writeArray[], int32 *sampsPerChanWritten, bool32 *reserved)`
   - Inputs:
     - `taskHandle` - Handle to the task that contains the analog output channel(s) to write to.
     - `numSampsPerChan` - Number of samples per channel to write.
     - `autoStart` - Specifies whether the task should automatically start when writing begins.
     - `timeout` - Timeout value (in seconds) for the write operation.
     - `dataLayout` - Specifies the layout of the write array (e.g., DAQmx_Val_GroupByChannel to write channel-wise).
     - `writeArray` - Array containing the voltage values to write.
   - Outputs:
     - `sampsPerChanWritten` - Number of samples per channel actually written.
     - `reserved` - Reserved for future use.
   
   This API is used to write analog voltage values to one or more analog output channels. It takes the task handle, the number of samples per channel, the write array containing the voltage values, and other parameters as input. It provides the number of samples per channel actually written as an output.

5. DAQmxReadAnalogF64
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxReadAnalogF64(TaskHandle taskHandle, int32 numSampsPerChan, float64 timeout, int32 fillMode, float64 readArray[], uInt32 arraySizeInSamps, int32 *sampsPerChanRead, bool32 *reserved)`
   - Inputs:
     - `taskHandle` - Handle to the task that contains the analog input channel(s) to read from.
     - `numSampsPerChan` - Number of samples per channel to read.
     - `timeout` - Timeout value (in seconds) for the read operation.
     - `fillMode` - Specifies how to fill the read array when the requested number of samples is not available (e.g., DAQmx_Val_GroupByChannel to group samples by channel).
     - `arraySizeInSamps` - Size of the read array in samples.
   - Outputs:
     - `readArray` - Array to store the read voltage values.
     - `sampsPerChanRead` - Number of samples per channel actually read.
     - `reserved` - Reserved for future use.

   This API is used to read analog voltage values from one or more analog input channels. It takes the task handle, the number of samples per channel, the read array to store the voltage values, and other parameters as input. It provides the number of samples per channel actually read as an output.

6. DAQmxStopTask
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxStopTask(TaskHandle taskHandle)`
   - Input: `taskHandle` - Handle to the task to be stopped.
   - Output: None

   This API is used to stop a running task. It takes the task handle as input and stops the associated task.

7. DAQmxClearTask
   - Function Signature: `DAQmxClearTask(TaskHandle taskHandle)`
   - Input: `taskHandle` - Handle to the task to be cleared.
   - Output: None

   This API is used to clear a task and release associated resources. It takes the task handle as input and clears the task.

These are some of the commonly used DAQmx APIs in data acquisition applications. They allow you to create tasks, configure analog input/output channels, write analog output voltage values, and read analog input voltage values. By utilizing these APIs effectively, you can interface with data acquisition devices and perform various data acquisition operations.
